# Getting Started

Welcome to **BlueCharter** (myBlue). This guide will walk you through everything you need to get up and running with the platform.

## What is BlueCharter?

BlueCharter is a document and invoice management platform built for yacht charter companies. It centralizes your fleet documentation, tracks invoices from your accounting system, and provides a clear overview of your business operations.

### Key features

- **Document Management** -- Upload, organize, and review documents for each yacht in your fleet
- **Invoice Tracking** -- View invoices synced from Odoo, filter by payment status, and download PDFs
- **Dashboard Overview** -- See active yachts, unpaid invoices, and recent activity at a glance
- **Role-Based Access** -- Admins manage the full fleet; company users see only their assigned yachts and documents

## Your Dashboard

Once you log in, you land on your personalized dashboard.

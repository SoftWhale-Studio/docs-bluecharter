# Registration

BlueCharter uses an **invitation-based** registration system. You cannot create an account on your own -- an administrator must invite you first.

## How to Request Access

To get started with BlueCharter, send an email to:

**admin@bluecharter.fr**

In your email, include:
- Your **full name**
- Your **company name**
- Your **email address** (this will be used for your account)
- The **yachts** you need access to (if known)

The BlueCharter team will create your account and send you an invitation email.

## What Happens Next

1. **You receive an invitation email** -- Check your inbox (and spam folder) for an email from BlueCharter
2. **Click the invitation link** -- This will take you to the account setup page
3. **Complete your profile** -- Fill in your name and set a password
4. **Start using BlueCharter** -- You'll be redirected to your dashboard

For a detailed walkthrough of the account setup process with screenshots, see the **[Account Setup](/docs/getting-started/onboarding)** guide.

## Joining Additional Companies

If you need access to additional companies within BlueCharter, your administrator can assign you to more companies. Once assigned, you'll immediately see the new company's yachts, documents, and invoices in your account.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Didn't receive the invitation email | Check your spam/junk folder. Contact admin@bluecharter.fr if still missing. |
| Invitation link expired | Ask your administrator to resend the invitation. |
| Password not accepted | Make sure it's at least 8 characters and includes a mix of character types. |

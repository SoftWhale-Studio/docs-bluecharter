# Registration

BlueCharter uses an **invitation-based** registration system. You cannot create an account on your own -- an administrator must invite you first.

## How to Request Access

To get started with BlueCharter, send an email to:

**admin@bluecharter.fr**

In your email, include:
- Your **full name**
- Your **company name**
- Your **email address** (this will be used for your account)
- The **yachts** you need access to (if known)

The BlueCharter team will create your account and send you an invitation email.

## What Happens Next

1. **You receive an invitation email** -- Check your inbox (and spam folder) for an email from BlueCharter
2. **Click the invitation link** -- This will take you to the account setup page
3. **Complete your profile** -- Fill in your details and set a password
4. **Start using BlueCharter** -- You'll be redirected to the dashboard

## Setting Up Your Account

When you click the invitation link, you'll see the account setup form. Fill in:

- **First Name** -- Your first name
- **Last Name** -- Your last name
- **Password** -- Choose a strong password (at least 8 characters)
- **Confirm Password** -- Re-enter your password to confirm

Your password must be strong enough to pass the strength meter. We recommend using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Once you submit the form, your account is ready. You'll be redirected to the login page.

## Joining Additional Companies

If you need access to additional companies within BlueCharter, your administrator can assign you to more companies. Once assigned, you'll immediately see the new company's yachts, documents, and invoices in your account.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Didn't receive the invitation email | Check your spam/junk folder. Contact admin@bluecharter.fr if still missing. |
| Invitation link expired | Ask your administrator to resend the invitation. |
| Password not accepted | Make sure it's at least 8 characters and includes a mix of character types. |

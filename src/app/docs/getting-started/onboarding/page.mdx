# Account Setup

After receiving your invitation email, you'll need to complete your account setup before you can start using BlueCharter. This page walks you through each step of the onboarding process.

## Step 1: Open the Invitation Link

When an administrator invites you to BlueCharter, you'll receive an email with an invitation link. Click the link to open the account setup page.

> **Tip:** If you don't see the email, check your spam or junk folder. The email comes from BlueCharter.

## Step 2: Complete Your Profile

After clicking the link, you'll be taken to the **Complete Your Account** page.

You'll see your email address already filled in. Complete the form with:

- **First Name** -- Enter your first name
- **Last Name** -- Enter your last name
- **Password** -- Choose a strong password (at least 8 characters)
- **Confirm Password** -- Re-enter the same password

### Password Tips

Your password should include a mix of:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters (e.g., !, @, #)

The stronger your password, the more secure your account will be.

## Step 3: Complete Setup

Click the **Complete Account Setup** button. If everything is valid, your account will be created and you'll be redirected to your dashboard.

- **Explore your [Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/dashboard)** -- See an overview of your yachts, documents, and invoices
- **Browse your [Documents](/docs/documents)** -- View and download yacht-related documents

# Invoices

The Invoices section lets you view and manage all invoices synced from your accounting system (Odoo).

## Overview

The Invoices page displays all invoices in a grid layout. Each invoice card shows:

- **Invoice number** -- The unique invoice reference (e.g., "2026-02-0018")
- **Client name** -- The company or entity the invoice is for
- **Total amount** -- The total amount including taxes, displayed in euros
- **Invoice date** -- When the invoice was issued
- **Payment status** -- Current payment state (see below)
- **Due date** -- When payment is expected
- **View Invoice** button -- Opens the full invoice detail

## Payment Status

Invoices are color-coded by their payment status:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Not Paid** | The invoice has not been paid yet |
| **Partial** | A partial payment has been received |
| **Paid** | The invoice has been fully paid |

## View Modes

You can switch between two view modes using the toggle at the top:

- **Grid view** -- Card-based layout (default), great for scanning multiple invoices
- **List view** -- Row-based layout, useful for comparing invoice details side by side

## Viewing Invoice Details

Click **View Invoice** on any card to open a detailed preview.

The invoice detail shows:
- Full invoice header with company information
- Invoice number, date, and due date
- Reference number
- Line-by-line breakdown of items, quantities, unit prices, taxes, and totals
- A PDF preview of the original invoice document
- A **download button** to save the PDF to your computer

## Data Sync

Invoices are automatically synced from your Odoo accounting system. The **Last sync** timestamp in the navigation bar shows when data was last updated. Click the **Sync** button to trigger a manual sync if needed.

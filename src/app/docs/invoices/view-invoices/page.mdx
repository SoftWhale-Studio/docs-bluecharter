The detail view includes:
- **Invoice header** -- Company logo, address, and VAT information
- **Client information** -- The billing party's name, address, and VAT number
- **Invoice metadata** -- Invoice number, date, due date, and reference
- **Line items** -- A table with each item's description, unit price, taxes, and total
- **PDF preview** -- A rendered preview of the original invoice document

## Downloading an Invoice

To download the invoice PDF:

1. Open the invoice detail (click **View Invoice**)
2. Click the **download icon** in the top-right of the dialog
3. The PDF file will be saved to your computer

## Switching View Modes

At the top of the invoices page, you'll see two tabs:

- **Grid view** -- Cards arranged in a responsive grid (default)
- **List view** -- A more compact, table-like layout

Click either tab to switch. Your preference is remembered.

## Understanding Invoice Numbers

Invoice numbers follow the format set by your accounting system. Common patterns include:
- `2026-02-0018` -- Year-month-sequence number
- `SAL1/2025/00005` -- Custom prefix/sequence formats

These numbers are unique identifiers that match your Odoo accounting records.

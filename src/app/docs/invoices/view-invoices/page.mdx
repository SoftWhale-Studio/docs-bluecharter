3. The PDF file will be saved to your computer

## Switching View Modes

At the top of the invoices page, you'll see two tabs:

- **List view** -- A more compact, table-like layout

Click either tab to switch. Your preference is remembered.

## Understanding Invoice Numbers

Invoice numbers follow the format set by your accounting system. Common patterns include:
- `2026-02-0016` -- Year-month-sequence number
- `SAL1/2025/00003` -- Custom prefix/sequence formats

These numbers are unique identifiers that match your accounting records.

### Available Filters

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Payment Status** | Filter by Paid, Partial, or Not Paid |
| **Company** | Show invoices for specific companies |
| **Date Range** | Filter by invoice date or due date |

## Filtering by Outstanding Invoices

To see only unpaid invoices:

1. Click the **Filter** button
2. Select **Not Paid** under the Payment Status filter
3. The list will update to show only invoices that haven't been paid

This is one of the most common uses -- quickly seeing what's outstanding. You can also access this view directly from the dashboard by clicking **View All** next to the "Unpaid Invoices" card.

> **Tip:** The dashboard's "Unpaid Invoices" count links directly to the invoices page pre-filtered to show only unpaid items.

## Combining Filters

You can apply multiple filters at once. For example:

1. Filter by **Not Paid** payment status
2. Select a specific **company**
3. Search for a specific **invoice number**

This narrows down your results to exactly what you need.

## Clearing Filters

To remove all filters and see the full invoice list:
- Clear the search bar
- Open the Filter panel and deselect all active filters

## Sharing Filtered Views

When you apply filters on the invoices page, the URL updates to reflect your current filters. You can share this URL with colleagues to show them the same filtered view (provided they have access to the same data).

For example, you might share a link that shows all unpaid invoices for a specific company -- useful for following up on overdue payments.

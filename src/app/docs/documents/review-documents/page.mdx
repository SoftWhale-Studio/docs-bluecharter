# Review Documents

BlueCharter includes a document review workflow to ensure all uploaded documents are properly verified before being finalized.

## Document Status

Every document in BlueCharter has a status that tracks where it is in the review process:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pending User Review** | The document has been uploaded and is waiting for the company user to review it |
| **Pending Admin Review** | The company user has reviewed the document and it's now waiting for admin approval |
| **Approved** | The document has been approved by an administrator |
| **Rejected** | The document was rejected and may need to be re-uploaded |

## For Company Users

As a company user, when a document is uploaded for your yachts, you may be asked to review it:

1. Go to the **Documents** page
2. Look for documents with a **Pending User Review** status
3. Click on the document to preview it
4. Verify the document details are correct
5. Confirm the review

The document will then move to **Pending Admin Review** for final approval.

## For Administrators

As an administrator, you can approve or reject documents:

1. Go to the **Uploads** page from the sidebar
2. Review the uploaded documents
3. For each document, you can:
   - **Approve** -- The document is finalized and visible to all relevant users
   - **Reject** -- The document is sent back and may need to be re-uploaded

## Downloading Documents

You can download any document at any stage by clicking the **download icon** on the document card. This downloads the original file to your computer.

## Previewing Documents

Click on any document card to open a preview. For PDF documents, you'll see an in-browser preview of the file content. For other file types, you can download and view them locally.

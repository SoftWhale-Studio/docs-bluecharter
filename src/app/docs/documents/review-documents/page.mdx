# Review Documents

BlueCharter includes a document review workflow to ensure all uploaded documents are properly verified before being finalized.

## How It Works

When you upload a document through the **My Uploads** page, it goes through a review process before it becomes available in the main Documents section:

1. **You upload a document** -- The document is submitted and waiting for review
2. **Admin reviews the document** -- An administrator categorizes the document, assigns it to the correct yacht, and verifies the content
3. **Document is approved** -- Once approved, the document appears in the Documents section for all relevant team members

## Document Status

Documents can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pending Review** | The document has been uploaded and is waiting for an administrator to review it |
| **Approved** | The document has been reviewed, categorized, and is visible in the Documents section |
| **Rejected** | The document was rejected and may need to be re-uploaded with corrections |

## Checking Your Upload Status

To see the status of documents you've uploaded:

1. Go to **My Uploads** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to the upload history section
3. Check the status of each document

## Downloading Documents

You can download any document from the Documents section by clicking the **download icon** on the document card. This downloads the original file to your computer.

## Previewing Documents

Click on any document card in the Documents section to open a preview. For PDF documents, you'll see an in-browser preview. For other file types, you can download and view them locally.

# Filters & Search

BlueCharter provides several ways to find the documents you're looking for.

## Search Bar

At the top of the Documents page, you'll find a search bar. Type any keyword to search across:

- Document titles
- Filenames
- Tags

Results update as you type.

## Filter Button

Click the **Filter** button next to the search bar to open the filter panel.

The filter panel lets you narrow down documents by:

### By Company
Select a company to see only their documents. This is useful if you have access to multiple companies and want to focus on a specific one.

### By Yacht
Select a yacht to see only documents associated with that vessel. This is the quickest way to find all documentation for a specific yacht.

## Category Tabs

Use the category tabs to filter by document type:

- **All Documents** -- Everything
- **Boat** -- Boat-specific documentation
- **Contracts** -- Charter agreements and contracts
- **Insurance** -- Insurance certificates and policies
- **Transport** -- Transport-related documents
- **Legal** -- Legal paperwork
- **Finance** -- Financial documents

## Combining Filters

You can combine all filter methods together. For example:

1. Click the **Contracts** tab to show only contract documents
2. Open the **Filter** panel and select a specific yacht
3. Type a keyword in the **Search** bar

This will show you only contracts for that specific yacht that match your search term.

## Clearing Filters

To reset all filters:
- Clear the search bar
- Click **All Documents** tab
- Remove any active company or yacht filters from the filter panel

## Sharing Filtered Views

When you apply filters, the URL in your browser updates to reflect your current filter state. You can copy and share this URL with colleagues -- when they open it, they'll see the same filtered view (provided they have access to the same data).

## Filling in the Upload Form

### Step 1: Company & Yacht Details

- **Company** (required) -- Select the company this document belongs to from the dropdown

### Step 2: Document Details

- **Document Files** (required) -- Click **Choose File** to select the document from your computer. Supported formats include PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, JPEG, and PNG files.
- **Language** -- Select the language of the document (defaults to English). You can click **Add another language** if the document is available in multiple languages.
- **Document Type** (required) -- Select the type of document from the dropdown (e.g., Charter Agreement, Certificate of Ownership, Contract, Insurance, etc.)
- **Document Title** -- Optionally enter a custom title. If left empty, a title will be auto-generated based on the document type and yacht name.

### Step 3: Document Metadata

- **Document Visibility** -- Choose who can see this document:
  - **Visible to All** -- All company members can view the document
  - Other visibility options may be available depending on your setup

### Step 4: Submit

Click the **Upload Document** button to upload. The document will be processed and added to the system.

## After Uploading

Once uploaded, your document will appear in the Documents list. Depending on your organization's workflow:

- The document may go through a **review process** where an administrator reviews and approves it
- It will be associated with the yacht and company you selected
- Other team members with access to that yacht will be able to see and download the document

## Tips

- Make sure the file is not larger than **10 MB**
- Use clear, descriptive titles so documents are easy to find later
- Select the correct document type for proper categorization
- Upload documents in the correct language for your team
